     “ I thought Japan is far beyond my expectations. By looking at Japan with my own eyes. I became more interested in science and 
     technology and I began to understand the importance of science and technology after participating Sakura Science Exchange
     Program.Also, when we  think about things, and when we try to do something, we must first think about the ethics and common
     benefit of mankind.I think I have broadened my horizons by participating in this program.”
