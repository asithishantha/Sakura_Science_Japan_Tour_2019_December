                                  “ I thought Japan is far beyond my expectations. By looking at Japan with my own eyes. 
                                  I became more interested in science and technology and I began to understand the
                                  importance of science and technology after participating Sakura Science Exchange Program. 
                                  Also, when we think about things, and when we try to do something, we must first think about
                                  the ethics and common benefit of mankind.I think I have broadened my  horizons by participating
                                  in this program.”
